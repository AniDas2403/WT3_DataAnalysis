The Online teaching system is rather Disadvantageous in my opinion, there are network connectivity issues and the whole system of education becomes somewhat boring when it's done in front of the screen for hours without any interactions especially! 

Internet connection stability is a necessity. Other than that, interactive sessions can make it interesting and screen sharing, showing interesting slides and tutorial videos. 

I think teaching online is a difficult task and so is gaining knowledge from it. The system can be functional if both the sides manage to interact well during classes. 

In my opinion, I'd still like to stick to the good old method of offline education system where technology will be used in teaching methods but there would be a direct interaction between the teacher and the student.
