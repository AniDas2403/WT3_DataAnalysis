Advantages: could be the lack of pressure and more time being available at hands. And a more structured customisable way of teaching. 
Disadvantages: poor connections and the one to one help which helps psychologically as well. Man is a social animal and teaching and interaction in person is always a better alternative

Better ui and separate rooms to ask for help. One on one interaction in special classes. And integration of platforms such as google classrooms directly with google meet.

Integrity with organisational platforms which help in collection of notes and materials and are directly accessible during the class

No. A physical system is much better because of the interaction and related psychological comfort
