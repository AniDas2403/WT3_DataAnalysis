The advantage of online teaching system is that it allows students to view lectures at their own time. The disadvantage is that the connection between students and professors doesn't feel the same as it would be in an in-person teaching scenario.

The professors should be more open-minded and flexible in the delivering their courses.

Use a video player that allows to play the lectures at various speeds.

Difficult to choose, but I would prefer a mix between an online teaching and an in-person teaching system.
