The online education system allows professors to record their lectures, subsequently allowing the students to view the recorded lectures at their convenience. Time management becomes easier. There is no hassle of going from your home to the classroom.

Severely undercuts the teacher student interaction and the classroom environment experience.

Could be improved by ensuring good stable connections and good video and audio quality.

I would like to see a phone app being used to sync with the online classroom platform to carry out interactive classroom questioning sessions, allowing professors and students to ask and answer questions seemlessly during the lectures, without having to interrupt the lectures.

A mix of both the online and in class systems. I would prefer a system, which is adaptable and time-management friendly like the only sytem, with proper student-professor interaction and the classroom experience.
