Flexibility when it comes to attending classes since you are not bound by physical location. 
Saved time to get ready for a class, you don't have to go far.

The different time zones in which the instructor teaches and the student attends may be impactful to different students depending on location.
Issues related to good internet access. In cases where you can't have access to recorded lectures, if the internet shuts off it's makes it hard to keep up.
Depending on your location, it may be too noisy to keep up with classes or take exams in a quiet environment

I would prefer the in-class teaching experience. I find so much value in physically being in class and interesting directly with peers and the instructors. It could be a think to do with perspections, but the experience is not the same in my opinion.
