Doing stuff on your own time and taking your time to understand the material

Depending on the class it can be easier to split up the lecture into smaller parts instead of one video 

It would beneficial to have flags on specific parts for the lecture. EX Flag 1 is intro...Flag 6 is conclusion

Online, it can be easier for the prof to communicate the material from a recording instead of being put on the spot in the middle of the class and random questions. The prof can also answer these questions via email or regard them in a class discussion while giving him or her the time to think for the best answer and possible add on questions from the class.
