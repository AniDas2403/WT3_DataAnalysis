lectures are most of the time recorded giving the option and availability to watch and review lectures at a later time.

profs are more likely to ignore feedback and concerns about delivery and material. Easier to ignore students complaints. There is no additional information given as students are likely anxious to ask questions online or feel there is not enough time.. technical difficulty with delivery takes up extra time not accounted for in the schedule so giving over time is a common issue.

Have profs account for technical difficulty. Prevent going over time and running into other lectures. Have profs actually trained on online delivery of material. encourage feedback from students directly to profs about how the lectures can be improved in delivery.

A "hands up" tool similar to Microsoft teams. Address questions at end of lectures to save on time and delivery during and for the flow of recorded lectures.

In class teaching is far superior. People are social by nature. Interactive learning is the best for quality of education.
