Advantages: The class environment is at home, therefore it is more comfortable for students, there is no need of transportation to a classroom, which makes it easier to attend classes (unless of a timezone-related problem).
Disadvantages: Some students will not grasp the content as easily as if it was explained in class by the professor, students have a harder time approaching thewir respective instructors, and at times there may be some connection issues or platform issues to attend classes.

Since online-teaching has been a new system for most students, considering expanding the instructor's office hours for a bigger range of options could significantly help students struggling with the online-teaching technologies.

The option of instructors doing a poll before or after class related to the content previously given to fully understand (from the instructor's perspective), if the class is grasping the content equally as good as if the classes were given in person.

In-class teaching is the choice I would take, mainly because in-person classes opens your perspective regardijng the content and you can ask questions to your instructor shortly after, as well as the university life, which is a major reason why students go to university, for the university environment, connections, lessons learned, library, among other features.
