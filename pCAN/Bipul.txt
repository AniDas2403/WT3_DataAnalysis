Advantages: The main advantage is that the lectures are recorded. The students can watch several times if they want. I have been told the recorded lectures were helpful during the preparation for exams. Another advantage is that in Newfoundland we did not have to cancel or reschedule lectures due to snowstorms.
Disadvantages: Very few students ask questions during the lecture. In regular classroom teaching, when one student asks a question, many other students get benefit from that. Sometimes the discussion continues and that leads to in-depth learning. Students also cannot meet the instructors and cannot have face-to-face discussion.

Exams are the most challenging part for instructors and students. As it is not invigilated, it is very difficult to identify which sources students use. More specifically, for undergraduate courses where it is not a good idea to give the open-book challenged exam, as graduate courses.

Laboratory test components should be somehow accommodated, if possible.

In-Class teaching. Better communication between students and instructors.
