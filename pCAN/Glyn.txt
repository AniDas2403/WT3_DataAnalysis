For asynchronous (prerecorded) material (and for synchronous material that is recorded for later viewing), students can view the material at a time convenient for them.   They can pause the playback and they can rewind to view again any points of confusion.

Live tutorials and "office hours" can be more productive as a result.

Lack of personal interactions, for students with each other and for students with instructors.

Some students lack suitable quiet areas in which to attend online classes.

If synchronous class content is not recorded, then students in distant time zones are likely to be disadvantaged.

For the instructor: add edit features for videos recorded in D2L's "online rooms".

no comment at this time.

In class, for the interaction reason stated above; but also record classes (as I did in some of my pre-pandemic courses) for later review by students and to help students who must be absent from a class.
